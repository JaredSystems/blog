I'm Jared. I'm 25 years old and based out of Miami, FL.

I'm a software engineer currently focused on offline first systems and hardware integrations.

Nowadays i'm working on [@marmotsystems](https://www.marmotsystems.com/) — a direct store delivery and accounting solution.

I mostly spend my time engineering software, unpacking abstractions, or eliminating technical debt.

If you would like to hire me, work with me, or just chat, you can [email](mailto:jaredgomez0812@gmail.com) me or schedule a [call](https://cal.com/jaredsystems).

<hr> <p>I’m 25 years old, based out of miami, fl, and enjoy programming. I got into programming in late 2022 when I wanted to build a <a href="https://www.freemindrecovery.com/">mental health platform</a> for myself. It’s very trivial, but it’s what I utilized to learn full stack software development. Surprisingly, it grew to more than 1000 users with no marketing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I ended up back in uni to study computer and information technology hoping to land a job, as the stigma of not having a bachelors was creeping up on me. Shortly after, I landed a software internship at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist">Truist</a> on their enterprise engineering team. There was too much red tape, so I did nothing all internship and don’t really want to go back to corporate.</p>
<p>To kill time over my internship I studied <a href="">gamification</a> and <a href="">intelligent tutoring systems</a> with the end goal of building an automated AI math tutoring application. <a href="https://www.galaxitylearning.com/signin">Galaxity</a> is the result of this work. It integrates into existing learning management systems to tutor students on their homework. Initially, my end goal was to release a prototype to schools, but shortly after I realized b2a and edtech is not an industry I want to be in.</p>
<p>Nowadays I’m working on <a href="https://www.marmotsystems.com/">@marmotsystems</a> — a direct store delivery and accounting solution.</p>
